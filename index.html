        <h3>Welcome to Pandorita's GitHub Page</h3>

<p>Pandorita is a native Mac OS X client for the internet radio service Pandora.  It is written entirely in Cocoa, and built to be lightweight, easy to use, and fully functional.  Internally it uses the amazing <a href="https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar">pianobar</a> library to communicate with Pandora's server.  </p>

<h3>So what can it do?</h3>

<p>Pandorita is still in its very early stages, so many features are not yet implemented and some features may have bugs.  That said, nearly everything you would want to do with Pandora can already be done in Pandorita.  Currently, you can use Pandorita to: </p>

<ul>
<li>Stream tracks from any station.<br>
</li>
<li>Rate tracks, including ones which have already finished playing.<br>
</li>
<li>View album artwork for the current song.<br>
</li>
<li>Create stations by searching for artists and songs, as well as rename or delete existing stations.<br>
</li>
<li>Enable Growl notifications.
</li>
<li>Enable global hotkeys.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Last.fm scrobbling is soon to come as well.</p>

<h3>Cool!  Where can I get it?</h3>

<p>You can download the latest version (0.3.1) <a href="http://coneill-math.github.com/Pandorita/releases/0.3.1/Pandorita-0.3.1.tar.gz">here</a>.  If you are feeling adventurous, you can download and build the absolute latest source from the Github repository, but be warned, this is likely to contain bugs.</p>

<h3>Support or Contact</h3>
